# Contaminant_model_brisbane_airport
The group has been engaged to develop a contaminant transport model to estimate the likely spatial extent and travel time of a contaminant in aquifer that is hydraulically connected to a series of coastal streams and an enclosed tidal embayment. 
During the period from 1988 to 2010 (22 years) it is estimated that approximately 700-750 L of a chemical leaked into ground at the site. The chemical release was not constant and is thought to have occurred over a 1- hour period at least once a month during the 22-year period in which it was used at the site. The chemical was released at the ground surface is thought to have rapidly infiltrated the soil profile and entered the underlying unconfined groundwater system. It is estimated that approximately 2.75 L per month was released at the site in this way (i.e., pulse loading of 2.75 L of chemical each month for the 22-year period from 1988 to 2010).
